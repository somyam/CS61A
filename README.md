Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs 


My projects and homeworks for CS61A, Spring 2019. cs61a.org. Not to be copied.

From instructors:

CS61A is "an introduction to programming and computer science focused on abstraction techniques as means to manage program complexity. Techniques include procedural abstraction; control abstraction using recursion, higher-order functions, generators, and streams; data abstraction using interfaces, objects, classes, and generic operators; and language abstraction using interpreters and macros. The course exposes students to programming paradigms, including functional, object-oriented, and declarative approaches. It includes an introduction to asymptotic analysis of algorithms. There are several significant programming projects."

Languages: Python3, SQL, Scheme
